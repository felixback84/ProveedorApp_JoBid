#Â state-utils

state-utils is a set of utilities for managing application state in JavaScript
client applications. It is also a dumping ground for other work I'm doing.

Everything is designed to work in IE8 and above.

Data fetching in IE8 only works if all your URLs have the same scheme as the
host. So for example, if you server your app from http, all the data sources
must be http. It is just one of those strange IE browser quirks.

There is a strong focus on testing.
